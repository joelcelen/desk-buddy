## Description

"DeskBuddy" is an environment monitoring system to help people who sit and work. The system has two components: the Wio device that monitors the environment and notifies the user, and the Android app where users can define their optimal environment profiles and select their notifications.

The Wio device continuously monitors temperature, humidity, and light levels. These are displayed graphically at the desk of the user, and indicators change color according to user-defined preferences. The sensor data is sent to the Android app in real-time where they are displayed on the home page, and stored in a database from which users can obtain and plot historical measurements. The Wio device also periodically notifies the user that they have been sitting too long and that they need to stand up and stretch. Users can continue working and monitoring their environment after pressing a button. The device also displays one-time or periodic user-defined notifications, as well as motivational messages, which can be defined or customized in the Android app by the user.

Through environmental monitoring, motivational messaging, and user defined notifications, DeskBuddy allows users to work smarter, stay hydrated, and get regular physical movement.

## Getting Started and Installation
To be able to use this system, you need a [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html), the contents of this repository built and installed, and the following sensors:

- [Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11)](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TemperatureAndHumidity_Sensor/)
- [Grove - Light Sensor v1.2](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Light_Sensor/)
- [Grove - Multi Color Flash LED (5mm)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Multi-Color-Flash-LED-5mm.html)

## Purpose and Benefits

Since the pandemic, a lot of people have started working more or exclusively from their homes. Factors such as light, temperature, humidity affect people’s well being and it is something that is often forgotten or overlooked. Other factors that affect people’s well being are posture and taking breaks. 

The purpose of this project is to improve people's health, and their working or studying environment while they are working or studying from home. 

Through sensors to measure various factors in their home, and consecutive reminders to check their posture and take breaks. We believe this system will help a lot of people improve their working environment, and benefit them feel better while they are working out of the comfort of their own homes.
